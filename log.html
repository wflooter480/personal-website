        This is my first entry into my ongoing quest to learn how to code. This log is to serve as a quick look into what I have been learning. A couple days ago, I started my website in earnest.
        I got my head wrapped around what Bootstrap is and does. And most importantly, how it can help me get a website up fairly quickly. When I took the html and css courses, everything was done from scratch ,
        so this almost seemed like cheating. But I will not complain; it has been pretty handy so far. Today I played around with the background image and formatting the first section and nav bar. Honestly, if you had told me 4 months ago
        I would know what any of this is, I would have laughed heartily. So, I'm pleased that this stuff doesn't look completely foreign to me. I was worried at first getting back to html and css as I have
        been working with javascript for the past several weeks. And since before Christmas, I was really just focused on practicing writing functions. That's where my head has been, but I need to continue moving forward,
        esspecially with this website. I want a career as a software developer - I think a website is not only a good way to put what I've learned into practice.

        Here's to more log entries and a successful year transitioning into a new career!
