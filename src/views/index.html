                  <p> After learning the entire soundtrack to Annie at the age of 4, my parents handed me the easiest 
                    instrument a frequently moving 5 year old could cart around: a flute. Playing the flute was pretty 
                    much my life’s focus for the next 20 years. I practiced the flute. A lot. After college graduation, 
                    I practiced more, but I also got a 9-5 job to pay the bills. Still played my flute and taught lessons 
                    to some great kids (and adults). Worked a little more. Practiced a little less. Got promoted at work. 
                    Grew an interest in tech. Quit my job to learn to code. Built this website from scratch. Itching to 
                    learn more and make a career change into software development. </p>

                <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                <p>After graduating from music school a decade ago, I have found myself in a rising 
                  position at a non-profit health insurance company. My goals have always been to 
                  be and do the best I can. I enjoy diverse yet unified collaboration and love working 
                  on a team that shares the same goals. My fear has never been that of failure, but 
                  that of stagnation and not performing and succeeding to the best of my abilities. 

                    For the two years, I have been working on a special team to upgrade our contribution 
                    accounting, enrollment, and eligibility system. My responsibilities on the project 
                    have been gathering business requirements, communicating and documenting business 
                    and functional requirements to our software vendor, analyzing and mapping data for 
                    conversion, and testing the new system and functionality. We have been working with 
                    Jira and in an agile environment. I have been grateful for this opportunity and look 
                    forward to learning and growing even more in the future.</p>
